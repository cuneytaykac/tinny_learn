# Privacy Policy for Tiny Learners

**Last updated:** January 30, 2026

**Tiny Learners** ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of your children. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our mobile application tailored for children.

## 1. No Personal Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, share, or sell any personal information.**

*   **No Accounts:** The app does not require you to create an account or log in.
*   **No Tracking:** We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking tools (like Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, or Mixpanel) to track user behavior.
*   **No Ads:** The app is completely ad-free. We do not use any advertising networks (like AdMob or Unity Ads).

## 2. App Permissions and Data Usage

The app may request certain permissions to function correctly, but these are essentially processed locally on your device:

*   **Internet Access:** Although the app is designed to work offline, internet access might be used by the underlying operating system or strictly for fetching app updates or verifying licenses if applicable by usage store policies. "Tiny Learners" itself does not transmit user data to any server.
*   **Local Storage:** We use local storage (Hive/Shared Preferences) solely to save your child's progress (e.g., unlocked levels, game settings) directly on the device. This data never leaves your device.
*   **Audio/Speaker:** The app uses the device's audio capabilities for sound effects and text-to-speech features. No audio is recorded.

## 3. Children’s Privacy (COPPA & GDPR-K Compliance)

Our app is designed for children and families.

*   We comply with the **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**.
*   We comply with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, specifically regarding children's data (GDPR-K).

Since we do not collect any personal data, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction).

## 4. Third-Party Services

While we do not share data, the app is built using **Flutter**. You can review Google's policies as the provider of the Flutter framework, though our implementation does not utilize their data collection services.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
